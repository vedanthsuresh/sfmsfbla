      <p class="fbla-text hidden m-0 p-3">SFMS has one of the most competitive FBLA chapters in Georgia. We have won Chapter of the Year six years in a row as of now.
      Our chapter consistently has participants in NLC (National Leadership Conference) and has won countless amounts of awards and recognitions. SFMS FBLA provides many 
      different opportunities to participate in community service. Some of these opportunities include writing letters
      for school police officers, clothing drives, giving free school supplies, and more! Our chapter ensures each student has an incredible experience while also enhancing their leadership skills.
      For example, membership in our chapter can include a fun trip to Six Flags for the FBLA Fall Rally, a trip to Athens, GA for FBLA's Fall Leadership Conference, and a trip to Columbus, GA for FBLA's State Leadership Conference.
      Doing well in your competitive events can also enable the opportunity to go to San Antonio, Texas, for the National Leadership Conference. Students can also build their leadership skills through guest speakers and officer tryouts.
